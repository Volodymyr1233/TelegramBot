This is my Telegram Bot build with Python, BeautifulSoup and requests.

🧑‍💻Functionality:

✅ Bot parses information from the page: https://maximum.fm and gets jokes about politics and school.
✅ User can choose category
✅ Bot add user to our database (file: "telegram_bot.db")
✅ After choosing category bot gives him random joke.

Hope you enjoy my project🙌
